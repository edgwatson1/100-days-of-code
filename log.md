# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: Jan 19th, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Built a basic quote generator which displays Stoic quotes.

**Thoughts:** I had to remind myself how to set up CSS from scratch well, as I'd been relying on Bootstrap containers. I'm not used to vanilla JS as I'd been doing a lot of React but it was good - and surprisingly simple. I learnt something new to launch functions on page load i.e. `<body onload="codeAddress();">.`I used https://femmebot.github.io/google-type/ for font inspiration which was incredibly useful.

### Day 1: Jan 20th, 2020

**Today's Progress**:  I've been working through the callbacks and higher order function challenges on @willsentance's great Javascript: The Hard Parts course (on @FrontendMasters). Revisited foreach, map, reduce etc. now knowing exactly how they work.

**Thoughts:**: Reminded myself on foreach, map, reduce etc. Can see benefits of higher order functions and generalising functions in large code bases. Realising functions are first-class objects makes understanding simpler i.e. that you can pass them as arguments, return them from functions etc.

### Day 2: Jan 21th, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Spent time trying to work through an authentication flow. I've created an Express/JWT/Passport/MySQL backend & separate frontend. But haven't got it working yet. Gonna resort to a tutorial on this - feel like in practice, it's simpler than I'm making it.

**Thoughts:**: Authentication flow isn't obvious at first but backend is relatively new to me so I suspect t'll get easier with practice. Need to follow a tutorial on this one first I think.

### Day 3: Jan 21th, 2020

**Today's Progress**: I wanted to test out Material-UI for React. So I started building the structure for a Twitter clone frontend. To be styled and populated with faker.js at another time... https://github.com/marak/Faker.js/

**Thoughts:**: Not sure to extent I can customise Material-UI components - they might end up being restrictive more than they are useful but for putting something together quickly they seem really good.

Need more practice mapping over objects/arrays to render, and need to work out how to create infinite scroll effect and keeping pulling data from API as the user scrolls.
