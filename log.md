# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: Jan 19th, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Built a basic quote generator which displays Stoic quotes.

**Thoughts:** I had to remind myself how to set up CSS from scratch well, as I'd been relying on Bootstrap containers. I'm not used to vanilla JS as I'd been doing a lot of React but it was good - and surprisingly simple. Learn something new to launch functions on page load i.e. `<body onload="codeAddress();">.`
